# crack-segmentation-using-yoloV7
This project focuses on crack detection using the YOLOv7 (You Only Look Once version 7) object detection model. The work was conducted as part of a research internship at NIT Calicut. The dataset used for training and evaluation is sourced from Roboflow, providing a diverse and comprehensive collection of crack images for robust model training.

Introduction:

Cracks in concrete structures pose a significant threat to their structural integrity and overall safety. The objective of this project is to develop an accurate and efficient deep learning-based crack detection system using YOLOv7. This real-time object detection framework will enable the identification of cracks in images with high precision, facilitating effective maintenance and repair measures.

Dataset:

The crack dataset used in this project was obtained from Roboflow, a platform that provides annotated datasets for various computer vision tasks. The dataset consists of a diverse collection of images, each labeled with bounding box annotations around the cracks. The dataset was split into training and testing sets to train and evaluate the YOLOv7 model effectively.

Model Architecture:

YOLOv7 is a popular and state-of-the-art object detection model, which utilizes a deep convolutional neural network to perform real-time object detection tasks. The architecture consists of several convolutional layers, followed by detection layers that predict bounding boxes and class probabilities for detected objects.

To run this project, run the google colab notebook provided.
